# Budget Tracker
This app's purpose is to be utilized while travelling and as a feature it utilizes indexedDB to cache updates while offline.

This app utilizes IndexedDB, PWA Methodologies, Node, Mongo, and Node.JS. 

I struggled a bit with getting IndexedDB to work for me but was eventually able to get it to store offline.

# Usage/ How to install
This app is deployed on Heroku and does not require installation. If you would like to install it, you can clone the repo, open a terminal and type: npm i seed the database with npm run seed or node seeders/seed.js Then type node . to use it on localhost:3000.

# Credits
This app had starter code in the public folder for front end content and some backend code was provided. The indexedDB and PWA technologies were written by yours truly.
